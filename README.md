# Objective of theProject
The objective of this project is to analyze and visualize the trends and impacts of urbanization in South Asia using Python. Through data-driven insights, the project aims to:

Highlight economic growth patterns, demographic changes, and quality of life indicators in urban areas.
Provide a comparative analysis of GDP, GDP per capita, and population growth across countries over time.
Explore correlations between health indicators, such as life expectancy and infant mortality, to assess the socio-economic effects of urbanization.
Facilitate intuitive understanding through interactive and informative visualizations for policymakers, researchers, and the general audience.
This project seeks to make complex urbanization data accessible and actionable through effective Python-based data analysis and visualization techniques.







Python
Library used: 
-Numpy:For efficient numerical computations and generating random numbers
-Pandas:Useful for organizing and analyzing the data generated by a simulation
-Matplotlib:For 2D/3D plots of the random walk
 # DataSource(s)
 The dataset used in this project is not available on Kaggle or other public repositories. Therefore, it was created independently for the purpose of this analysis.
 # Execution Steps(Howtoruntheproject)
 1. Set Up the Environment:Install Python and the necessary libraries
 2. Download/Prepare the Project Files
 3. Open the Script/Notebook
 4. Run the Simulation:For a Jupyter Notebook: Open the notebook and run all cells sequentially.
 5. Visualize Results:Look at the output plots (1D/2D random walk graphs) generated by the code & Save the plots if needed (use plt.savefig() in the code).
 6.  Analyze it.
# Summary of Results
This Python project focuses on analyzing and visualizing urbanization trends in South Asia using a dataset containing economic and demographic indicators. The primary tools and libraries utilized are Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib for data manipulation, cleaning, and visualization.

Key Features of the Project:
Data Cleaning:

Columns such as GDP, GDP growth, GDP per capita, and population growth are cleaned by removing non-numeric characters and converting them to numeric types for accurate analysis.
Visualizations:

Line Plot: Displays the trend of GDP over the years for a specific country, e.g., India.
Bar Chart: Compares GDP per capita across multiple countries for a specific year, highlighting economic disparities.
Scatter Plot: Explores the relationship between life expectancy and infant mortality rates, providing insights into the quality of life.
Examples of Analysis:
GDP Trends Over Time: By plotting GDP over years, the project illustrates economic growth patterns for selected countries.
Economic Comparison: Bar charts make it easy to compare economic performance (GDP per capita) of South Asian countries in a given year.
Life Expectancy and Health: Scatter plots reveal the correlation between life expectancy and infant mortality, reflecting health conditions in the region.
Tools and Techniques:
Data Manipulation: Pandas for structured data handling.
Plotting: Matplotlib for creating customized visualizations.
Interactive Insights: Functions allow for dynamic visual analysis by choosing specific countries and years.
The project effectively utilizes visual tools to uncover trends and correlations, providing a comprehensive perspective on urbanization's socio-economic and health impacts in South Asia.
